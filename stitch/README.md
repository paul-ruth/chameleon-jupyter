* Running the Sample Application
1. You will need a [GENI cert](http://www.exogeni.net/2015/09/exogeni-getting-started-tutorial/) to create slices on ExoGENI.
1. `mvn clean package`
1. `java -cp ./target/stitch-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar org.renci.chameleon.jupyter.stitch.App certLocation keyLocation controllerURL sliceName`
    * `certLocation` and `keyLocation` will come from your GENI cert creation
    * `controllerURL` could be ExoSM: `https://geni.renci.org:11443/orca/xmlrpc`
    * `sliceName` can be of your choosing
1. You can verify slice creation using [Flukes](https://github.com/RENCI-NRIG/flukes)

* References
  * This project uses [Ahab](https://github.com/RENCI-NRIG/ahab) to create virtual infrastructure on [ExoGENI](www.exogeni.net).
